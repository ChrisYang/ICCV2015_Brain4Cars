Code for ICCV2015 paper "Car That Knows Before You Do: Anticipating Maneuvers via Learning Temporal Driving Models"

Please note, we have currently released our source code (both for training and testing) and the feature vectors. This will allow reproducing our results and further development. We will soon release the raw sensor data (cameras and GPS)  and will provide a download link.
